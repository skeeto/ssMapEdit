# synSpace Map Editor

Exactly ten years ago, in 2004, I released the second version of the
*synSpace Map Editor* for a game called [synSpace][synSpace]. The game
never had an official map editor, so my editor became the de facto map
editor.

* Binary download: [ssMapEdit.zip][bin] (756kB)

That's also the original build, since I've lost the ability to
actually compile it anymore.

While it was fairly effective at its job, it's an ugly, horrible mess
of Visual Basic 5.0, born out of my amateur programming skills at the
time. I originally released the source code with the binary but, out
of ignorance, never properly marked it suitably as open source
software. To celebrate its 10th anniverary, I hereby release the
entire thing into the public domain. You can ignore any statements
contradicting this in the original sources. I leave them there for
historical reference.
